# Circonus - Staging

The entry point for Terraform for HashiCorp's staging environment
(a.k.a. `oasis`).

## Usage

Do *NOT* run these commands.  At the moment the `.terraform.tfstate` file is
hosted on Sean's laptop.

See the `GNUmakefile` for details, but the gist is `make plan` and `make apply`.
